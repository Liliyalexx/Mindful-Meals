## Overview
Mindful Meals is a full-stack application designed to help users find restaurants that cater to specific dietary needs. Whether you're gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, halal, kosher, or have food allergies, Mindful Meals helps you discover restaurants that meet your requirements.


Our team built this application to address the challenge of finding suitable dining options for people with dietary restrictions. By integrating with the Yelp API and adding our own user-friendly features, we've created a solution that makes dining out more accessible for everyone.


## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up, login, and logout functionality
- **Favorites System**: Save your favorite restaurants for quick access
- **Interactive Map**: Visualize restaurant locations on a map
- **Review Filtering**: See reviews that specifically mention your dietary preference
- **Responsive Design**: Works across desktop and mobile devices
